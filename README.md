# Psychic-Game

## Technologies used: visual studio code

## Summary: The purpose of this assignment was to make practical use of the elementary knowledge of Javascript that we have learned. This assignment was tough, not going to lie. I know I have some coding errors in the assignment, but I tried to assign variables and use if statements to make sense of the code. For some reason, I'm unable to get an output, but I know that the actual code in making things operate isn't far off. While I'm no master of Javascript by far, I found this excerise helpful in trying to understand the language better. It forced me to think about the working mechanics in bits.


## Steps:
1. Throughout the week I tried to prepare a mental blue print in my mind of the function parts, for example, I remembered how we could get a computer's guess from the math floor/random technique, and I knew we could assign all letters of the alphabet to an array to get the app to choose one of them.

2. I set up my repo and included the involved files and folders.

3. I went back and took a look at the solution for the rock, paper, scissors game as I knew a lot of this game would "piggy back" off of the mechanics of that excercise. 

4. Using the RPS excercise I applied the code to have the code recognize a key press event, an array for the computer to select, and other details.

5. Another solution to RPS introduced me to the technique of creating a variable and have it ++ or increment by one when either a guess, win, or loss occurred.

6. I created an array for userguess in which there were 9 empty strings, so that the array had a length to refer back to when a user hit their max guesses. I then pushed the key guess to the array so the document could display it under the guessed area.
